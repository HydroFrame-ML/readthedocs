Introduction
============
Hydrodata is a large GPFS file share located at Princeton that contain a large
number of hydrology related data files. The files in hydrodata are indexed by
a data catalog.

The index is provided to allow code that needs to read information from /hydrodata
to access the information without hard coding absolute path names to the files. 
This index makes it easier for people and code to locate files and understand
the purpose of the files.

There is a python module to help programs get metadata and file paths from the data catalog. 

The data catalog consists of a set of objects (tables) that can be joined together
by common keys. The "tables" are represented in a
yaml file `hydrodata_catalog.yaml` file rather that a SQL database so the information
can version controlled, branched, promoted and labeled.
